# What are strings?

Hopefully you know a little about strings from the last lesson. This lesson will give you an in-depth look at what they are and how to perform operations on them. A string is a **sequence of characters**. Well what is a sequence and what are characters? A sequence is a list composed of elements (or items). Characters are just letters, numbers, and symbols on your keyboard. But to a computer they are represented as numbers, since a computer can only deal with numbers. So we humans made a system of encoding letters as numbers so that we can store text as numbers. This encoding is called **ASCII**.

You might be wondering what char, dec, oct, and hex stand for. Well, char just means character and dec means decimal, which is the name for our normal number system. Oct and hex stand for octal and hexadecimal, neither of which you need to know right now, but in case you are wondering, they are just different number systems that represent numbers differently. If you look at the table, you can see that each character corresponds to one number, which is how the computer stores the information for each character. This means that in computer memory, strings are just lists of small numbers, but when we display strings, the computer automatically converts the numbers to characters so that we can read the text!
